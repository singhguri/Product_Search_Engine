For the best deals on computers in Canada, Best Buy is the first place most people think of, and for good reason. Take our huge selection of computers and accessories, sprinkle in some incredible sales and deals, and you've got the ideal destination for picking up your next computing device. Have Fun and Get Things Done with a Laptop When it comes to enhancing your digital life, a laptop is a must-have. Today's laptops are powerful enough to handle everything you throw at them, from power-intensive tasks like gaming and video editing to everyday stuff like browsing the web and flipping through photos. Since they're portable, you can use one wherever you want: check your Facebook feed while sitting on the couch in front of the TV, finish a report while sipping a foamy drink at the coffee shop, or bring it to your buddy's place to show off photos from your amazing travel adventure. Play and Work Anytime, Anywhere with a Tablet Tablets hit the sweet spot between form and functionality. They're small enough to fit into your bag, but have enough screen real estate to provide an enjoyable experience for watching videos and reading eBooks or articles. Some models are basically laptops in tablet form, complete with laptop-grade hardware and operating systems (like Windows 10). Simply connect a keyboard (and maybe a mouse or stylus) and you've got fully-functioning computer in a package that's compact enough to carry around everywhere you go. Desktop Computers Provide Maximum Power and Productivity If you prefer to use your computer while sitting at your desk or need to do some heavy-duty work, a desktop computer is the way to go. You can get great computer hardware for a reasonable price, and PCs are upgradeable so you can swap out a processor or boost the memory if you feel the need. Some desktops are designed for specific uses: a gaming PC features high-octane hardware that can handle graphics-heavy games, while a mini PC includes budget-friendly, customizable components that are perfect for a variety of uses. Make Your Computer Even More Useful with Add-ons and Accessories Once you've decided which type of computer meets your needs, you can start looking for add-ons and accessories that'll enhance the experience. If you want bigger visuals, pick up a monitor and get all the screen you need. Networking components, like wireless routers, are essential for creating a Wi-Fi hotspot so you can keep your laptop or tablet supplied with a strong wireless signal throughout the house. Printers allow you to produce important documents, and some multifunction models can also scan and make copies. Need to carry your laptop around? Pick up a laptop bag or case so it can be a constant companion throughout your busy day. Want more info about computers & tablets?
